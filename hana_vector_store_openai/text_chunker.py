MINI TEMPLATE — Text Chunker
============================================================
Use this when: you have loaded documents and need to split
them into smaller pieces before generating embeddings.

Why chunk? Embedding models have token limits and smaller
chunks give more precise similarity search results.

Chunking strategy: RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
  -> tries to split on: paragraphs -> lines -> sentences -> words

Setup:
  pip install langchain
